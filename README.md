Agentic AI agent for data analysis
Plan of Action:
1. Input Stage
  Receive dataset (full dataset or subset).
  Validate input:
    Check format (CSV, Parquet, JSON, SQL, etc.).
    Check schema consistency (columns, types).
    Verify file integrity (size, missing headers, encoding issues).
2. Data Profiling
  Run exploratory scan:
    Column types (categorical, numeric, datetime).
    Missing values, duplicates.
    Outliers and anomalies.
  Distribution of key features.
  Summarize metadata (row count, column count, uniqueness, correlations).
3. Data Cleaning
  Handle missing values: impute, drop, or flag.
  Remove or mark duplicates.
  Handle outliers: winsorize, log-transform, or remove.
  Normalize column names (consistent casing, no spaces/special chars).
  Ensure type conversions (e.g., strings → datetime, int → float).
  Apply standard encodings for categorical values (label encode, one-hot).
4. Data Transformation
  Feature engineering:
    Aggregates (sum, mean, median).
    Derived fields (ratios, rolling averages, differences).
    Normalization/scaling.
    Dimensionality reduction (PCA, feature selection).
    Join with external reference datasets (if needed).
    Reshape (pivot/unpivot).
5. Inference & Insights
    Descriptive analytics: distributions, trends, correlations.
    Diagnostic analytics: why values behave a certain way (e.g., drivers of churn, anomalies).
    Predictive modeling (if included):
    Train lightweight ML models (regression, classification, clustering).
    Provide forecasts or clusters.
    Prescriptive insights: recommended actions based on trends (e.g., “reduce marketing spend on X, increase on Y”).
6. Output Stage
    Return results in structured formats:
    Cleaned/transformed dataset (CSV, Parquet, SQL table).
    Insight summary (Markdown, PDF, dashboard).
    Visuals (matplotlib/Plotly charts).
    Log audit trail: document cleaning rules, transformations, and models used for reproducibility.
7. Continuous Learning (Optional)
    Store feedback on quality of insights.
    Adapt cleaning/transformation heuristics for future datasets.
    Maintain knowledge base of past datasets to improve inference accuracy.
